# TCP MULTI-CLIEN-CHAT-APPLICATION | PYTHON

## Objective

To create a secure and scalable TCP-based multi-client chat application that enables real-time messaging between authenticated users, demonstrating core networking concepts like socket programming, threading, authentication, and broadcast communication in Python.

Key Features
- User Authentication: Requires username/password login with stored credentials
- Concurrent Connections: Handles multiple clients simultaneously using threading
- Broadcast Messaging: Sends messages from one client to all others
- Connection Management: Tracks online users and cleans up disconnected clients
- Basic Security: Uses thread locks to protect shared resources

### Skills Learned

- Network programming fundamentals
- Thread synchronization
- Client-server interactions
- Basic chat application architecture

### Tools Used
- Python 
- Wireshark for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Virtual Environment (venv) (For dependency isolation)
